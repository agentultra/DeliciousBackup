Delicious Backup
----------------


Once you've cloned the respository, you can install it using setup.py:


'''
python setup.py install
'''

It will add a script to your PATH called 'dbackup'.

To back up your bookmarks, just run:

'''
dbackup --username=<your-username> --password=<your-password> --file=<path-to-your-new-db>
'''

Of course, you can get help on the options by just typing:

'''
dbackup --help
'''

I mainly just made this for myself, but if anyone finds it useful feel
free to use it and modify to taste.  100% public domain.
